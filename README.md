## Notes

Challenges faced creating this desktop app was refreshing on concepts to be used. Spent a lot of hours re-learning and trying my best to implement. How I overcame these challenges is by reaching out for help through Slack and reading the resources included in the challenges. There is a lot more to learn, refine, and discover. Thank you for reading!
